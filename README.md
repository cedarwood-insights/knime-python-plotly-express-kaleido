# Extending KNIME Python Integration with Plotly Express and Kaleido
This repo contains an example KNIME workflow similar to the one described in my Medium article ["Extending KNIME Python Integration with Plotly Express and Kaleido"](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/extending-knime-python-integration-with-plotly-express-and-kaleido-5c306074a5ca).

[![KNIME Workflow Desktop View](/assets/knime-workflow-desktop-with-images.png "Medium Article")](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/extending-knime-python-integration-with-plotly-express-and-kaleido-5c306074a5ca)

The KNIME workflow (.knar) file is an "export" (compressed archive) from the [KNIME Analytics Platform](https://www.knime.com/knime-analytics-platform) application. To use it simply "import" the file into your own installation of KNIME.

The example workflow is also available on the KNIME Hub [here](https://hub.knime.com/mike_h/spaces/Python%20View%20using%20Plotly%20Express%20and%20Kaleido/latest/~kx7a_cKchjPQrzXJ/).

Here is a screenshot of the example workflow opened in KNIME:

The Python code used to configure the Python View node in the workflow is available as a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/cedarwood-insights/dc6e62d162fc12c454c78e29060de230).

# Prerequisites
Naturally you will need to have access to the KNIME Analytics Platform application.
It can be downloaded from [here](https://www.knime.com/knime-analytics-platform).

You will also need to set up the KNIME Python Integration extension. Here is the [KNIME Python Integration Guide](https://docs.knime.com/latest/python_installation_guide).

Finally you will also need to install the [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/plotly-express/)* and [Kaleido](https://pypi.org/project/kaleido/) libraries. Please refer to my [Medium article](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/extending-knime-python-integration-with-plotly-express-and-kaleido-5c306074a5ca) for guidance.

(*) Note: the article was originally published in February 2021. Since then the Plotly Express library has been merged with the main Plotly library.
