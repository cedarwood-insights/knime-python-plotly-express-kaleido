# Extending KNIME Python Integration with Plotly Express and Kaleido
This repo contains an example KNIME workflow similar to the one described in my Medium article ["Extending KNIME Python Integration with Plotly Express and Kaleido"](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/extending-knime-python-integration-with-plotly-express-and-kaleido-5c306074a5ca).

[![KNIME Workflow Desktop View](/assets/knime-workflow-desktop-with-images.png "Medium Article")](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/extending-knime-python-integration-with-plotly-express-and-kaleido-5c306074a5ca)

The KNIME workflow (.knar) file is an "export" (compressed archive) from the [KNIME Analytics Platform](https://www.knime.com/knime-analytics-platform) application. To use it simply "import" the file into your own installation of KNIME.

The example workflow is also available on the KNIME Hub [here](https://hub.knime.com/mike_h/spaces/Python%20View%20using%20Plotly%20Express%20and%20Kaleido/latest/~kx7a_cKchjPQrzXJ/).

Here is a screenshot of the example workflow opened in KNIME:

The Python code used to configure the Python View node in the workflow is available as a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/cedarwood-insights/dc6e62d162fc12c454c78e29060de230).

# Prerequisites
